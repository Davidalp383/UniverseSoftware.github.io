Its lush 200-hectare campus, known as the Yunnan Garden, served as the Youth Olympic Village for the inaugural Youth Summer Olympics in 2010. NTU is ranked 11th globally according to the QS World University Rankings in 2017, and it is the fastest-growing university in the QS Top 50 worldwide.</p>
            <p>In general, NTU boasts a very modern and technological design. However, it is not only considered modern in its physical aspects but also as an institution. Computer engineering and systems engineering are both ranked in its top 10 programs.
