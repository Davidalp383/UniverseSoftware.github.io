            <p>It is an English public university located in the city of Cambridge, England, United Kingdom. Founded in 1209, it received a Royal Charter from King Henry III of England in 1231. Cambridge is the second oldest English-speaking university and the fourth longest continuously operational university. The university grew as a community of scholars who left the University of Oxford following a dispute with the residents of that town. Both medieval universities share many common features and are often referred to collectively as "Oxbridge." The history and influence of the University of Cambridge have made it one of the most prestigious in the world.</p>
            <p>This university provides one of the best educations in the field of engineering, including industrial, electrical, computer, and computational engineering.</p>
            <p>Cambridge offers projects that allow students in Industrial Engineering to develop software systems aimed at providing a more efficient and productive approach to the company or industrial force participating in the programs. This is why graduates often have significant job opportunities as software developers focused on industrial matters, contributing to the country's largest pool of professionals in this field.</p>
