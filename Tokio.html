            <p>Between 1886 and 1947, it was officially known as the Imperial University of Tokyo. It is generally considered the most prestigious university in Japan and one of the most prestigious in the world.</p>
            <p>The university has five campuses distributed in Tokyo (in Hongo, Komaba, Kashiwa, Shirokane, and Nakano) and is divided into ten faculties, with approximately 28,000 students, including 2,100 international students (a significant proportion for Japan, which has only 1.3% of foreigners in its population). The university also includes two hospitals to cater to this diverse student population.</p>
            <p>It is regarded as the most selective and prestigious university in Japan. As of 2021, alumni, professors, and researchers from the University of Tokyo include seventeen prime ministers, 18 Nobel laureates, four Pritzker Prize winners, five astronauts, and a Fields Medalist.</p>
            <p>The university's most recent contribution to the development of technologies and systems was in the creation of its own metaverse. This metaverse was developed by engineers and computer scientists who graduated from the university with the purpose of instructing new students in these fields within the university. Through interaction with this metaverse, students in these fields find it easier to initiate projects, develop software, and design systematic and technological models within the metaverse.
