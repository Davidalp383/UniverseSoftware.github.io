            <p>Finally, we have the National University of Singapore, known as NUS. It is the oldest university in Singapore and one of the top technological universities globally. It is part of the international university alliance and was founded in 1905 as a medical school. Later, it evolved into a leading university specializing in science and technology. The National University of Singapore is currently the top university in all of Asia according to experts, with the goal of becoming a global source of knowledge. Its students are divided across more than 14 different faculties, and the university also includes a hospital and a conservatory.</p>
            <p>The advantage that this university offers to science-focused careers, especially in systems and computer science, lies in the fact that its campuses (Kent Ridge, Bukit Timah, and Outram) are located in areas with significant industrial presence. This enables students to undertake internships and gain practical experience while pursuing their degrees. This aspect positions the National University of Singapore as one of the universities that produces the most well-prepared and experienced professionals in these fields in Asia.</p>
