            <p>Colloquially known as 'UJ,' it is a public university located in Johannesburg, South Africa. This university has been operational since January 1, 2005, following a merger between Rand Afrikaans University (RAU), Technikon Witwatersrand (TWR), and the Soweto and East Rand Vista University Campus. Prior to the merger, the Daveyton and Soweto campuses of the former Vista University had been incorporated into RAU. As a result of these mergers, it is common for students to refer to the university as RAU.</p>
            <p>The re-emerged institution is one of the largest comprehensive contact universities in South Africa, with nine faculties housing over 90 departments and an enrollment of approximately 48,000 students across four campuses. The university is one of the largest residential universities in the Republic of South Africa.</p>
            <p>While the university does not offer a wide range of technological programs, the three it provides receive significant support from the university council in terms of software development in their respective areas. These programs include a Master's in Education in Computer and Communication Technologies or Information Technology Management. They constitute a significant percentage of professionals who contribute to technology development in the nation of South Africa.</p>
