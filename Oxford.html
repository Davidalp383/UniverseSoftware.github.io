            <p>It is a public research university located in Oxford, England, United Kingdom. Without knowing the exact date of its foundation, there is evidence of an educational institution as early as 1096, making it the second oldest university in the world and the first in the English-speaking world. The university expanded rapidly from 1167 when King Henry II of England prohibited English students from attending the University of Paris. As a consequence of disputes between students and residents of Oxford in 1209, some professors moved northeast to Cambridge, where they founded what would later become the University of Cambridge. These two ancient universities are often collectively referred to as "Oxbridge." The history and influence of the University of Oxford have made it one of the most prestigious in the world.</p>
            <p>In the ranking of the university's students, the best-rated disciplines include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Medicine</li>
                <li>Computer Science</li>
                <li>Telecommunications Engineering</li>
                <li>Mechatronics Engineering</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The most impressive contribution of this university in the professional field of technology is in the development of telecommunications systems, including the creation of massive communication systems such as radio antennas, communication satellites, servers, and the development of technologies and systems in the field of fiber optics, among others.</p>
