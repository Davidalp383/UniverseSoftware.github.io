            <p>The University of Peking (abbreviated PKU, colloquially known in Mandarin Chinese as Beida) is a research-focused university located in Beijing, China, and is a member of the C9 League of elite Chinese universities. It is the first modern education institution established in China, founded in the late Qing Dynasty in 1898 with the name Imperial University of Peking, succeeding the Guozijian (Imperial College).</p>
            <p>Often considered the best university in China, it ranks among the top universities in Asia.</p>
            <p>In the field of computer science and systems (as in all the programs the university offers), competitiveness is fostered among the students within the university as well as with students from other universities. This competitive spirit also reflects in the professional careers of graduates from these programs, with a large number of professionals dedicated to developing the most modern technologies in Asia or leading the business field in the technology, systems, and computer industry in China.</p>
